I want to make a card game that is highly collectible-- maybe even extremely so.
The most fun part of this deck is cracking packs.

That means a lot of chase cards. Do you need much else than that?

1. 20 life is the set point. Wanted the game to go long, so cards that usually are beat by fast decks. Let them play!
2. Strategy Circle - Rush, Economy, Defense. Missing in Commander.
3. 8th card problem.
4. Limit direct interactions from other players -- to avoid kingmaking.
5. Plane chase. Add random effect from items? Help those behind, and hinder those ahead.

It needs to fill a collection.
