# RAGU

I want to make a card game that is highly collectible-- maybe even extremely so.
The most fun part of this deck is cracking packs.

That means a lot of chase cards. Do you need much else than that?

1. 20 life is the set point. Wanted the game to go long, so cards that usually are beat by fast decks. Let them play!
2. Strategy Circle - Rush, Economy, Defense. Missing in Commander.
3. 8th card problem.
4. Limit direct interactions from other players -- to avoid kingmaking.
5. Plane chase. Add random effect from items? Help those behind, and hinder those ahead.

It needs to fill a collection.

Why is drafting fun?

- Play with other people.

- Trading afterwards.
- It feels more relaxed? You make the decisions now.

Customers.

Drawing cards is like gaining knowledge?

What's missing for MVP?

- A collection viewer
- Multiplayer
- A discard pile
- The game itself

RAGU

What if your mana base ENABLES you to use cards from the middle.

So the "consistency" is from your card draw. You "work" your card by turning it. And only after 1 turn, can you "upgrade".

Each upgrade adds +1 to the resource.

Enchantment => Non-food actions that perpetually does something.

--

Cabbage Patch Kids
= Attach any Patch whenever a Kid enters.

Suspicious Seeds
= Grow a Fruit card after 3 Waters

Big Red Tomato
= Fruit
= Chop into 4 Sweet-Sour Flavors

Wishing Well
= Tap: Add 3 Water tokens.
= Wish: Add 1 additional token to another card.

Japanese Steel - Legendary
= Chop twice every turn.

--

Rush/Defense/Economy Strategy
= Rush to Help: Fast help now! Before anyone else.
= Defend Help: Defend any helps until we can help.
= Economize Help: Invest to be powerful later.

--

Every turn, the middle gets another Card.

Every 4 Spaghetti, the cards are put into effect and it starts the next phase.

--

You can only target / use cards from the player on your left.
= Person to your right is your Sous chef.
= Person to your left is your Head chef?

Gravy Train
= Give this to the player on your left
= They can put and take any number of tokens from it.
= They must pay 1 Gold for every token exchanged.
= Get 1 Gravy each time this is given to another player.

Brown Food => Generates a lot given a lot of investment?
= Economy players

Red Food
= Rush players

Green Food
= Defend players

how does deckbuilding work?
= it would be great to have a Hero, and you personalize it.
= what is the test of skill this deck would do?

Feed customers and you get money back?

Every turn a new customer arrives, and you must feed it. Otherwise, on the next phase, the effect is applied for that phase.

Each phase is a different part of the multi-step recipe.
= Maybe you can stockpile resources, hoping to blaze through the next phase?
= Or you feed all customers NOW, so it is easier next phase.
= Or you manipulate customers, so they are slowed down.

There are threats that target specific players, so you need some sort of balance and not COMPLETELY specialize.
= There could be droughts.
= There could be buyouts.
= There could be rotten food.

Actually, instead, let's just make early game hard to trade. And the player trading must pay Gold to trade. So a gold engine is necessary for every player.

How do you get gold?
= This should be the highest point of interaction.
= A test of skill could be here?

= Feed customers.
= Build a multi-card engine?

= TIMERS! are a big thing.
= As well as guessing when things are done transforming. Like coordinating against a random clock.

Your HERO should do the action:

Robot Chopper
= 1 gold: 1 chop per turn.

Al Dente Cook
Start with 2 dice at 1. Re-roll 1 dice each turn. Steam to Al Dente when both are 6.

Serving Size is the difficulty of the deck (what it can serve)
Perishable foods (so generating foods are not tokens, but Floating mana)

Hero cards have spaghetti recipes on them and can only be exerted X times.
= Then they need to be retired and another Chef takes their place (maybe a whole nother deck? or a partner chef in the same deck).
